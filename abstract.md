Today, batteries are widely used in power systems, providing energy storage, load balancing, and
support for renewable energy integration, as well as in electric vehicles. Lithium-ion batteries
are widely preferred due to their compact size and higher capacity. Despite their widespread use in
different sectors, cell imbalance in a battery pack affects its charging and discharging process and
the state of charge. To overcome this problem, different balancing techniques are employed using
various power electronics components. Cell imbalance can be reduced either by passive cell
balancing, where excess energy is dissipated as heat, or by active cell balancing, where energy is
transferred from cells with higher energy to cells with lower energy. This paper presents an
inductor-based active cell balancing technique, known for its high rate of energy transfer. Fuzzy
logic is used to drive the duty cycle of PWM switching signals, controlling the balancing
operation.


The performance of the system is compared with and without fuzzy logic by observing the state
of charge balancing of the cells during charging and discharging. A simulation model consisting
of four battery cells connected in series is used for analysis. The results show that, under the
given initial conditions, the fuzzy-logic-based balancing technique requires slightly less time,
and achieves a more uniform state of charge distribution compared to the system without fuzzy
logic.
