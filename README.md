# Inductor-Based Active Cell Balancing

## Description

This project focuses on an inductor-based active cell balancing technique for lithium-ion battery packs. Cell imbalance occurs due to aging, manufacturing variations, and different operating conditions, which affects battery performance, safety, and lifespan. In this method, energy is transferred from higher-energy cells to lower-energy cells using an inductor, reducing energy loss compared to passive balancing. Fuzzy logic control is used to improve the balancing process and make the system more adaptive under varying battery conditions.

## Tools Used

* MATLAB / Simulink
* Fuzzy Logic Toolbox

## Results

Simulation results are included in the project report. Graphs showing voltage and state-of-charge balancing, along with Simulink model images, are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed balancing method.
